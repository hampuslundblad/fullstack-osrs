# Scripts

- setup.sh, just general folder structure get stuff stuff
- install-cloudflared, well installs cloudflared.

# Notes

- setup-ssh.sh doesn't work with cloudflare tunnel out of the box at least. Might be due not having a proper A record pointing to the server, but since I don't want to hassle with port forwarding etc I'll with setup-ssh-cloudflare instead.
